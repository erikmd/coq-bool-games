Random Boolean games
====================

The Random Boolean games library for the Coq proof assistant provides a formalisation of Boolean games with random formulas as payoff functions.

It has been tested with Coq 8.8.0, MathComp 1.7.0, and Infotheo ae83217.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Coq and MathComp can be installed with OPAM - https://opam.ocaml.org
(or they can be downloaded, compiled and installed manually by
following the installation instructions on https://coq.inria.fr and
https://math-comp.github.io/math-comp).

Once OPAM is installed, type
    $ opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
    $ opam install coq.8.8.0 coq-mathcomp-character.1.7.0

When this installation step is completed, compile and install Infotheo
from the external directory:
    $ cd external/infotheo
    $ coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile && make -j2 && make install

Lastly, go to the src directory (which contains this README) and type:
    $ ./configure && make -j2

Documentation
-------------

To generate documentation from the Coq code using coqdoc and graphviz:

    $ make doc

The documentation can then be browsed from html/toc.html with
your favorite browser.
